It really all started when I landed my first real career-focused job post college at a company called Outsourced Ad Ops. While I had gained some very basic knowledge of onloine digital advertising during an Information Systems course as an undergraduate student at Boston University, I was *extremely* new to the game, and needed to learn everything on the job.

Over time, as my skills developed, I was learning more about the way advertising was bought and sold digitally at the time (circa 2015). This was primarily through my work with Google's advertising platform for publishers (which was called Doubleclick for Publishers at the time). The scope of my role as an Ad Ops Coordinator was to traffic "advertising tags" on behalf of publishers (think MSG, NCBUniversal, etc) into their advertising server (which was in many cases, Doubleclick) so that the advertiser's ads could target and run across the publisher's online inventory, ultimately reaching their intended audience. 

Outsourced Ad Ops was (and still is) a thriving business due to the technical skills our team had, which in many cases publishers lacked. These publishers desperately needed a team of experts to help them monetize their inventory and manage their advertising campaigns. This was my first foray into digital media, and the tip of the iceberg when it came to my interest in learning how to code.

As I continued into my career, my work with technical teams became more often and advanced. At Yahoo, I worked with our Salesforce engineers to develop and create a process which streamlined the distribution of prospects for our sales team. I worked with app developers to integrate Yahoo's Flurry Software Development Kit (SDK) in their apps so they can monitor analytics and generate revenue. Yet, there was a glaring void in my work, and there still is one to this day. While I enjoyed meeting people and understanding their business challenges, I felt dispensable. Just another sales guy. Yes, I was working with partners and responsible for selling the solutions, but I wasn't actually **building** the tools. I have tremendous respect for the engineers who can interpret language and develop really complex, intricate platforms, each with it's own unique purposes and intention. Even something as seemingly simple as the "Flappy Bird" app can take off (no pun intended) and change the culture as we know it.

The pith of why I want to learn about software engineeering is because I think it will allow for both more job stability and flexibility. Whenver you look at a companies job board site, 9 times out of 10 they have an opening for some sort of software development position. In some cases it will be focused on a particular language, sure. But I feel that having this skill in my aresenal will prove to be invaluable and inherently make me not just a more valuable asset for my current team, but ultimately at any business, whether it be someone else's or one I create on my own. Ultimately, this language is no longer that of the future, but is of the present. The sooner one learns to code, while it will be challenging, the better equipped they will be for an increasingly digital world.
